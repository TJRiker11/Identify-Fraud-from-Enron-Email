    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "> In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into the public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This project is to build a Person of Interest(PoI) identifier based on financial and email data made public as a result of the Enron scandal. A PoI is a person who falls under one of the following categories:\n",
    ">* Individuals who were indicted\n",
    ">* Individuals who reached a settlement or plea deal with the government\n",
    ">* Individuals who testified in exchange for prosecution immunity\n",
    "\n",
